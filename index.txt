I am a junior student doing my bachelor degree on Computer Science and Information system. I am an International student from Nepal. I came here in United States in 2018 in order to peruse my degree from this university. I studied my high school back home. I don`t have particular experience in computer science but I am acquiring it now here in Northwest.

I am not quite sure what I goanna do after graduation. However, I am interested in app development sector and database field.

I like to paint and listen music when I am alone and free.
